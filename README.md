"Easy" Tetris (take two). This is a fork of "TINT is not Tetris"
[tint-0.04+nmu1](https://packages.debian.org/jessie/tint) to
continue the game piece distribution experiment I started with
eastris-bsd. 

Since the reader probably does not know what that is: I modified
the BSD games version of Tetris to drop the same piece about 30
times in a row (there's a small chance of getting something
different). This changes gameplay significantly. In the end, I
found that the controls in that version of Tetris to be
unsatisfactory, hence moving to a new code base.
