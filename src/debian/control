Description: TINT Is Not Tetris(tm) ...at least the name isn't
 As the title suggests, this is a clone of the original tetris game
 written by Alexey Pajitnov, Dmitry Pavlovsky, and Vadim Gerasimov.
 .
 The game is as close to the original as possible, but there are a few
 differences.  Nevertheless, it's probably the closest to the original
 that you'll ever find in the UNIX world...
