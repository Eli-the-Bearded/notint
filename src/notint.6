.SH NAME
notint \- fork of the original tint, Tint Is Not Tetris
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B notint
.RI [ -c | -e | -t | -z | -S ]
.RI [ -l\  level ]
.RI [ -n ]
.RI [ -d ]
.RI [ -b\  char ]

.B notint
.RI [ -h | -s | -v]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B notint
fork. As with all games (and especially with notint), you have to play it,
not read about it.
.SH OPTIONS
Game play mode options (only one mode can be played at a time):
.TP
.B \-c
Play in
.I challenge
mode, where the board is pre-populated with blocks which must all be
cleared to advance the level.
Removing rows which contain no challenge blocks incurs a penalty.
.TP
.B \-e
Play in
.I easytris
mode, which has does not use normal random piece selection. Because
isn't it easier to know you'll get the same selection for most of the
next ten to thirty pieces?
.TP
.B \-t
Play in
.I traditional
mode, which is unchanged from the original 
.I tint
rules.
.TP
.B \-z
Play in
.I zen
mode, which stops the game speed from advancing and makes the score
all (and only) about lines cleared.
.TP
.B \-S
Play in a
.I speed
focused mode much like
.I zen
but score is based on lines cleared per minute (and zero for under
ten lines or one minute). Normal level advancement and with it, fall speed
increases apply.
.RE
.sp
Other game options:
.TP
.B \-l <level>
Specify the starting level (1-9). The higher the level you're starting from,
the faster the pieces move. Except for 
.I zen
or
.I speed
modes, you'll earn more points for piece dropping at higher levels. In
.I challenge 
mode, six of the first ten levels have a fixed pattern to solve (ie,
remove all those pieces). Levels 2, 7, 8, 9 and levels over ten just
have progressively trickier random messes to clean up. The challenge
blocks are distinguished with a different background character.
.TP
.B \-n
Draw next shape. In all modes but
.I zen
this comes at a score penalty.
.TP
.B \-d
Draw dotted lines. In all modes but
.I zen
this comes at a score penalty.
.TP
.B \-b <char>
Use the specified character (instead of spaces) to draw blocks.
.RE
.sp
Flags that do not result in playing a game:
.TP
.B \-h
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-s
Show high scores and exit.
.TP
.B \-v
Print the version and exit.
.SH CONTROLS
The most important controls are
.TP
.BI j " or " LEFT
Move piece left.
.TP
.BI l " or " RIGHT
Move piece right.
.TP
.BI k " or " RETURN
Rotate piece.
.TP
.BI SPACE " or " DOWN
Drop piece.
.RE
.sp
Additional controls:
.TP
.BI a " or " UP
Advance level (stops at 9, except in
.I zen
mode, which wraps around back to 1).
.TP
.B d
Toggle draw grid.
.TP
.B p
Pause game.
.TP
.BI q " or " Q
Quit game.
.TP
.B s
Toggle show next.
.SH SCORING
In the orignal game (still preserved as 
.I traditional
mode), scoring is heavily influenced by how far you "drop" a piece. This
scoring philosophy exists still in the 
.I easytris
and
.I challenge
mode as well. The
.I zen
and
.I speed
modes work on a scoring philosophy that lines cleared is the important score
criteria. One is a very simple just the lines removed score, and the other
has an adjustment based on lines per amount of time, favoring fast work. Those
two modes have no scoring bonus for merely dropping a piece, but recall that
dropping will make your game go faster for
.I
speed
mode.
.P
In all modes but
.I zen
to counter the advantages of the draw
grid and next piece preview options, those incur a scoring penalty. In
most of the modes with the penalty, it comes in the form of a divider.
The
.I speed
mode instead has the penalty reduce the time multiplier, a reduction that
goes all the way to zero in first few minutes or with too much accumulated
pause time.
.P
One other scoring scenario worth noting is
.I challenge
mode gives drop bonuses only if lines cleared does not exceed normal range
for the level. That is on say, level 3, drop bonuses only apply if less
than 30 lines have been cleared, 20 to 29 being the normal range for that
level. The
.I challenge
mode also has a penalty for clearing a line without any of the challenge
blocks. This penalty increases with level.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
Depending on compile time options, the high score file may use an environment
variable. The compiled-in value is shown in the version output:
.B nontint -v
Additionally, the variable
.B NOTINT_NAME
will be used as the default when adding entries to the high score file.
